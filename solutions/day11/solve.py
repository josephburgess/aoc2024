# if 0, replaced by 1 stone with the number 1
# if an even number of digits, split it into two stones: one for the left half, and one for the right half (drop leading zeros 1000 would become stones 10 and 0).
# if a stoneâ€™s number has an odd number of digits, multiply it by 2024
#
# start with the initial list of stones.
# for each pass, iterate over each stone and apply the transformation rules simultaneously - don't re-do any in a pass!
# track the total number of stones after each blink(?) or just count at the end?
# stop after 25 blinks and return the total count of stones.
#
# splitting in two parts:
# convert to string? len(str(stone)) % 2 == 0
# if string is "123456", string[:len(s)//2]  string[len(s)//2:]
# split and remove leading zeros from the second part (dont think we could get leading 0s for first half..) and convert back to nums
# actually converting to int should remove the 0s anyway
#
# keep it simultaneous>
# instead of mutating list in place, build a new list for each new state
#
# how to calculate stone count:
# each blink, count the number of stones in the list.
