# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

First time getting involved with [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/). Solving in Python because it's just a fun language to solve coding problems with.

If, for some strange reason, you want to see my solutions, just clone the repo, install deps, and run `main.py` to see the solution outputs for each day.
