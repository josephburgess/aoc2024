# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

First time getting involved with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Solving in Python because it's just a fun language to solve coding problems with :)

## Progress

- [x] Day 1
- [x] Day 2

## Solutions

If, for some reason, you wanted to see see the actual solution outputs for each day, just clone the repo, install deps and run `main.py`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/josephburgess/aoc2024.git
cd aoc2024
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
